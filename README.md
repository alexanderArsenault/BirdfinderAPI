# BirdfinderAPI

Leverages Google Maps API, Google Places Autocomplete API to create an application that dynamically generates pins on a google map that are near the users current location, or searched location. This SPA will then showcase all the birds that are available at that wildlife sancuary, using the petfinder API.
